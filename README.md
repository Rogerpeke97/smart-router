## Description

Smart Order Routing or shortly SOR is indeed a perfect tool to cope with ever changing prices and liquidity problems. This is an automated tool that helps process orders at the best price available across multiple markets in real time. In order to provide the best offer, it checks the current rate for any selected pair across different exchanges and helps to find the route to make a switch.

The advantages of such an approach are plenty. With the help of SOR, you can:

* Get best-priced trades for digital assets. SOR guarantees that the exchange will be conducted at the best rate across the linked exchanges.
* Execute orders in an automated way. Perhaps, one of the best things about SOR is that it reduces tenfold the amount of routine work that you have to do.
* Access liquidity across linked exchanges. The automated approach also helps you seamlessly switch big amounts of crypto across many exchanges instead of relying on a single market.
* Fast transactions with low latency. SOR has practically no effect on the speed of transactions as orders are executed nearly instantly.
* Tackle liquidity fragmentation and even benefit from it. SOR analyzes the current state of the market and places orders by defined rules and algorithms helping switch assets at the best rate.
* Leverage arbitrage opportunities. The automated technology can help you use the inefficiencies of various markets for your own good and make profits based on regional price differences.
The last benefit can be most interesting for sophisticated traders with solid experience behind their shoulders. Letâ€™s take a closer look and see how Smart Order Routing can help you not only eliminate inefficiencies of the cryptocurrency market but even make them work for you..
